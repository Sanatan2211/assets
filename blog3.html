                <h3>Introduction</h3>
               
                <p>If you're looking to get more exposure for your business on Facebook, then this guide is for you. We'll cover everything from creating a campaign and setting up targeting options to budgeting and scheduling your ads.</p>
                
                <h3>Let's Begin Your Journey Of Mastering facebook Ads Step by Step!</h3>

                <b>Step 1: Go to the Facebook Ads Manager Login Page.</b>
                <p>• Go to the Facebook Ads Manager Login Page
                </p>
                <p>• Click the “Create Ad” button
                </p>
                <p>• Enter your business information and click “Save and Continue”
                </p>

                <b>Step 2: Choose Your Campaign Objective and Goal.
                </b>
                <p>• In order to choose the best objective for your Facebook ad campaign, you need to understand the goals of your business. If you are just getting started and have no idea what your business does or where it fits in the marketing world, this step is for you.
                </p>
                <p>• You can use any objective or goal that aligns with what makes sense for your brand and target audience. For example:
                </p>
                <p>• Brand Awareness: The objective here is "to increase awareness about our company" - which would be achieved by posting content related in some way (i.e., something funny) or having people share their experience using our product/service on social media sites like Facebook where they'll see other people talking about us before they ever meet us face-to-face!
                </p>

               <b>Step 3: Set Up Your Facebook Ad Campaign Details.
            </b>
                <p>• Once you've set up your ad campaign, it's time to get down to business. When creating a Facebook ad campaign, there are a few things you'll want to think about first:
                </p>
                <p>• Name Your Campaign Name: You can name your Facebook ad campaign whatever you'd like as long as it isn't offensive or illegal. If you're unsure about what constitutes a good name for your campaign, we recommend naming it after something that relates to the product/service being advertised in the ad (e.g., "My Bacon Burgers Are Delicious").
                </p>
                <p>• Start Date and End Date: The start date controls when the ads will run and end date controls when they will stop running; these two dates should be within 30 days of each other so that advertisers have enough time between campaigns without having too much overlap between them (i..e., if an advertiser runs two separate campaigns back-to-back).
                </p>
                <p>• Daily Budget: This is how much money advertisers pay per day for every single impression they want their ads shown on Facebook; this amount varies depending on which targeting options were chosen during setup but usually ranges anywhere from $0-$10k per day!  It's important not only because it helps ensure quality control but also because if budgets get too high then advertisers might start using automated software tools instead which would result in lower quality metrics overall."
                </p>

                <b>Step 4: Targeting
                </b>
                <p>• Once you've created your Facebook Ads campaign, it's time to target your audience. There are several ways you can do this:
                </p>
                <p>• Location - Use the location field in Facebook Ads to target people who live in specific areas. For example, if I were selling tickets to an upcoming concert and wanted my ad to appear only in New York City, I would use this field when creating my campaign.
                </p>
                <p>• Demographics - You can also choose demographics for each of those ads based on age or gender so that only certain types of people see them (e.g., only women ages 18-35). This is especially useful if there are specific age groups that have already expressed interest in attending somewhere like a sports event or concert venue where tickets sell out quickly because they're already interested beforehand!
                </p>
                <p>• Behaviors - To target users based off their behavior patterns online (e.g., browsing history), simply add keywords related back into their profile information fields such as interests which include things like "Fitness" or "Running Gear." As long as those keywords match up with what kind content is being searched within Google search results pages then these terms will show up whenever someone searches something similar--and thus increase potential reach even further!
                </p>

                <b>Step 5: Facebook Ad Placement Options.
                </b>
                <p>• Facebook ad placements are the places where your ad will appear. There are many different types of Facebook ad placements, such as News Feed and Audience Network. You can choose between them based on what type of audience you want to target, how much budget you have, and other factors like location or device type.
                </p>
                <p>• For example: if you're trying to reach people under 35 years old who live in New York City with a budget of $100 per day (the minimum amount required), then News Feed would be a good choice because it has been proven that this demographic spends more time reading articles than any other demographic - even though they're not necessarily looking at ads during those times because they're busy scrolling through their feed!
                </p>

                <b>Step 6: Budget & Schedule.
                </b>

                <p>• Budget: This is how much you are willing to spend on each individual ad. The amount of money available to spend will be determined by the industry standard and market conditions, so it's important that you know what the average cost per click (CPC) is in your area.
                </p>
                <p>• Schedule: How often do you want your ads to run? If an ad runs once every week but it costs $5 per click, then this means that if all goes well and there aren't any other expenses related to running the campaign (like paying for Facebook ads), then one day’s worth of ad spending could ultimately net around $50!
                </p>

                <b>Step 7: Select Your Ad Format & Creative Asset.
                </b>
                <p>• Select Your Ad Format & Creative Asset
                </p>
                <p>• Ad format: A facebook ad consists of one or more images, text and/or video. The size and placement of these elements determine how they are displayed on your page.
                </p>
                <p>• Ad creative: This is the visual part of your ad which includes images and text that will appear in response to people clicking on it through Facebook's ad platform. It also includes a call-to-action button (CTA) telling users what you want them do next when they click through from the post!
                </p>

                <p>• Placement: If you're using a vertical image for an iPhone 6S Plus promo ad, make sure there's enough room for all those pixels! We recommend using Apple’s camera roll app so that we can crop out any unwanted space around our photos before submitting them as part of our campaign creation process."
                </p>

                <b>Step 8 (optional): Add Additional Assets & Finalize Your Facebook Ad.
                </b>
                <p>• If you're adding assets to your ad, you can do so at this point. You can add images, videos and call-to-actions (CTAs) to increase the effectiveness of your paid ad.
                </p>
                <p>• The first step in adding additional assets is choosing what type of asset will be used in the campaign by clicking on "Add an Image" or "Add a Video" under each asset type that has been created for this campaign. Once an image has been added to an ad, it will appear onscreen with text overlaying it that reads "[Your Name] Facebook Ad."
                </p>
                <p>• Next up is adding titles for each title block underneath each image: these are called title blocks because they fill up all available space on every single image within that campaign—and they're necessary if we want people who see our ads not only see them but also remember them!
                </p>

                <b>Takeaway:
                </b>
                <p>• Facebook ads can be a great way to reach your target audience. But before you jump into the world of paid advertising, it's important to understand how Facebook works and how campaigns work.
                </p>
                <p>• Here are some things that we learned while creating our first campaign:
                </p>
                <p>1.) Create a Facebook Ad Campaign - You'll need an ad account in order for this process to begin. It's free!
                </p>

                <p>2.) Target Audience - When creating your ads, choose who you want targeted at based on their interests or demographics (age range). This can be done by either targeting people based on their current location or by targeting those who recently visited specific locations like restaurants or shopping malls within the past year (or other time period).
                </p>
                <p>3.) Set Up Your Ads - Once created, select which type of product/service will be promoted through this campaign (iStock Photo vs Instagram Video).</p>
                <p>4) Budget And Schedule - Once set up according as well as budgeted for each day/week/month etc., schedule accordingly so that there isn't any overlap between when one ad starts than another begins because then users might not see both at once which would cause confusion over what type was being advertised too much information overload!</p>
